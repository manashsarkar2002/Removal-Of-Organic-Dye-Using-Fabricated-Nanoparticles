## 🧪 Synthesis Method

- **Chemicals Used**: FeCl₃ (Ferric chloride) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide)
- **Steps**:
  1. **Precipitation**: Iron salts are reacted with NaOH to form a precipitate.
  2. **Centrifugation**: The precipitate is separated and purified.
  3. **Drying**: The solid is dried to remove any remaining solvent.
  4. **Calcination**: High-temperature treatment is used to form crystalline FeO/Fe₂O₃ nanoparticles.

## ⚙️ Experimental Setup

- **Dye Concentration**: 10 ppm Methylene Blue solution
- **Nanoparticle Dosage**: 10 mg
- **Instrumentation**: UV-Visible Spectrophotometer used for analyzing dye concentration before and after treatment.

## 📈 Results

- **Efficiency**: ~96.78% dye removal
- **Conclusion**: The method demonstrates strong potential for use in industrial-scale wastewater treatment due to its simplicity, high efficiency, and low environmental impact.
